# Plant-Co.- guided Report

## Key Insights
- <b>Worst performing countries:</b> China, France, and Sweden are the largest contributors to the decrease in sales in 2023, with China showing the most significant decline.
- <b>Monthly Sales Drop:</b> The largest drop in Sales YTD vs PYTD occurred in February 2023, with a decrease of -0.35 million. Breaking this down, 0.26 million of this decline is attributed to China, with indoor and landscape products contributing -101k and -153k respectively.

## Recommendations
- <b>Targeted Analysis:</b> Investigate the factors contributing to low sales in China, France, and Sweden, prioritizing China due to its significant impact.
- <b>Marketing Focus:</b> Concentrate marketing efforts on accounts in the upper left quadrant of the scatter chart—those with high gross profit but low sales/quantity. These accounts have the greatest potential for profit growth if marketing strategies are effective.
- <b> Efficiency optimization:</b> For accounts in the lower right quadrant of the scatter chart—where there are high sales/quantity but low gross profit—prioritize potential operational improvements. Enhancing profit margins slightly can lead to substantial increases in absolute profit, leveraging the high volume of sales for greater financial impact.

## Summary of Plant Co. Project
- <b>Treemap Visual:</b> Highlights the bottom 10 countries in terms of YTD vs PYTD values, making it easy to identify the largest contributors to poor sales. This visual also integrates with the Waterfall chart for deeper insights.
- <b>Waterfall Chart:</b> Displays YTD vs PYTD sales per month, helping identify the worst-performing months. Combined with the treemap, it helps pinpoint areas for improvement and allows drilling down by country and product type.
- <b>Stacked Column Chart:</b> Compares YTD and PYTD sales and analyzes performance by product type within a quarter, providing an overview of which product types are performing well or poorly.
- <b>Scatter Chart:</b> Segments accounts into four groups based on gross profit relative to sales or quantity:
  - <b>Upper Left Quadrant:</b> High gross profit but low sales/quantity. This quadrant represents accounts with the highest potential for profit increase. Marketing efforts should focus here to boost sales and quantities.
  - <b>Lower Left Quadrant:</b> Low gross profit and low sales/quantity. This quadrant is less critical but should be monitored.
  - <b>Upper Right Quadrant:</b> High gross profit and high sales/quantity. These accounts are crucial for overall profit. Maintain and analyze these accounts to understand their success factors.
  - <b>Lower Right Quadrant:</b> Low gross profit but high sales/quantity. Focus on improving the profit margin for these accounts.
This structured approach allows you to prioritize actions based on the impact on sales and profit margins, leveraging data visualizations to guide strategic decisions effectively.
